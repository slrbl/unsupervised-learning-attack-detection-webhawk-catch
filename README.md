## About

Webhawk/Catch helps you to automatically find web attack traces in HTTP logs and abnormal OS processes without using any preset rules. Based on the usage of Unsupervised Machine Learning, Catch groups log lines into clusters, and detect the outliers that it considers as potential attack traces.

The tool is able to parse both raw HTTP log files (Apache, Nginx, ...) and files including OS statistics (generated by `top` command). The tool takes these files as input and returns a report with a list of findings.

Catch uses PCA (Principal Component Analysis) technique to select the most relevant features (Example: user-agent, IP address, number of transmitted parameters, etc.. ). Then, it runs DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm to get all the possible log line clusters and anomalous points (potential attack traces).

Advanced users can fine tune Catch based on a set of options that help to optimise the clustering algorithm (Example: minimum number of points by cluster, or the maximum distance between two points within the same cluster).

The current version of Webhawk/Catch generates an easy-to-read HTML report which includes all the findings, and the severity of each one.

Webhawk/Catch is an open-source tool. Catch is the unsupervised version of Webhawk which is a supervised machine learning based cyber-attack detection tool. In contrary to the supervised Webhawk, Catch can be used without manually pre-training a model, which makes it a lightweight and flexible solution for identifying potential attack traces easily. Catch is available as an independent repository in Github, it is also included as part of Webhawk which has been starred 125 times and forked 68 times.

## Setup

### Using a Python virtual env

```shell
python -m venv webhawk_venv
source webhawk_venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create a settings.conf file

Copy **settings_template.conf** file to **settings.conf** and fill it with the required parameters as the following.

```shell
[FEATURES]
features:length,params_number,return_code,size,upper_cases,lower_cases,special_chars,url_depth,user_agent,http_query,ip

[LOG]
apache:([(\d\.)]+) - - \[(.*?)\] "(.*?)" (\d+) (.+) "(.*?)" "(.*?)"
nginx:([(\d\.)]+) - - \[(.*?)\] "(.*?)" (\d+) (\d+) (.+) "(.*?)" "(.*?)"
apache_error:
nginx_error:

[PROCESS_DETAILS]

```

## Unsupervised detection Usage

### Catch.py script

```shell
python catch.py -h
usage: catch.py [-h] [-b] -l LOG_FILE -t LOG_TYPE [-e EPS] [-s MIN_SAMPLES] [-j LOG_LINES_LIMIT] [-p] [-o] [-r] [-z] [-y OPT_LAMDA]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b, --debug           Activate debug logging
  -l LOG_FILE, --log_file LOG_FILE
                        The input log file
  -t LOG_TYPE, --log_type LOG_TYPE
                        apache or nginx
  -e EPS, --eps EPS     DBSCAN Epsilon value (Max distance between two points)
  -s MIN_SAMPLES, --min_samples MIN_SAMPLES
                        Minimum number of points with the same cluster. The default value is 2
  -j LOG_LINES_LIMIT, --log_lines_limit LOG_LINES_LIMIT
                        The maximum number of log lines of consider
  -p, --show_plots      Show informative plots
  -o, --standardize_data
                        Smooth feature values
  -r, --report          Create a HTML report
  -z, --opt_silouhette  Optimize DBSCAN silouhette
  -y OPT_LAMDA, --opt_lamda OPT_LAMDA
                        Optimization lambda step

```

### Example with HTTP logs

Encoding is automatic for the unsupervised mode. You just need to run the catch.py script.
Get inspired from this example:

```shell
python catch.py -l ./SAMPLE_DATA/RAW_APACHE_LOGS/access.log.2021-10-22 --log_type apache --show_plots --standardize_data --report
```

The output of this command is:

### Example with OS processes

Before running the catch.py, you need to generate a .txt file containing the OS process statistics by taking advantage of `top` command:

```shell
top > PATH/os_processes.txt
```

You can then run the catch.py to detect potentially abnormal OS processes:

```shell
python catch.py -l PATH/os_processes.txt --log_type os_processes --show_plots --standardize_data --report
```

## Using sample data
